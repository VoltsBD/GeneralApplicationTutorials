This is a tutorial for the Application Dialogue

1. Dialogue may not be for all there is no mention of names for the God addressed in the Dialogue. 
   I typically use it when I wake up and I steady my mind and say the words.
   Then I proceed with my day. This is just a framework you can modify it to fit your purpose.
2. The 20 Word Script and the 30 Second Prayer is different its there to try to modify your mindset to wealth its kind of a way to do reprogramming
   add a different outlook to life. The 30 Second Prayer is based on my understanding something that was taught to my mother she showed it to me in the 80's
3. Which ever way you use it is up to you I hope that it benefits you as it has me in the past few years.
